IuzFirstRound=<body><img src="Iuz_the_Old.png"/><h2>Iuz the Old</h2>Sired by a demon prince upon the one-time Witch Queen of Perrenland, Iuz became a demi-god in his own right,<br>worshipped by those who cherish deceit, pain, and oppression. He began to build an empire in the northlands,<br>but was imprisoned many long years by the mad archmage Zagyg. Now he has broken free and returned to purge<br>his realm of those who assumed power in his absence.<br><br>Once again, the Empire of Iuz stretches south, pushing against the borders of Furyondy. But that is only the first<br>layer of his strategy. Iuz has stirred the Suel of the northeast to contemplate conquest, and also invited<br>the horsemen of Ket to invade from the west, for Iuz believes it is his right and destiny to rule all of Oerth.<br><br><b>Unique Advantage: Magic</b><br>When seeking magical artifacts, Iuz almost always succeeds.</body>
FuryondyFirstRound=<body><img src="Belvor_IV.png"/><h2>King Belvor IV of Furyondy</h2>When the Great Kingdom of Aerdy reached its zenith, several centuries ago, its westernmost reaches were known<br>as the Viceroyalty of Ferrond. As that empire began to wane, the Kingdom of Furyondy emerged as the most<br>powerful successor state in the region of Ferrond. But years of relative peace have left the kingdom ill-prepared<br>for the coming storm. Confident in the prowess of its renowned armies, Furyondy's nobles have prevented their king,<br>Belvor IV, from taking greater precaution against the return of Iuz.<br><br>Now can Furyondy withstand the Howling North? And if she, the shield of the north, should fall, what hope<br>can there be for rest of the Flanaess?<br><br><b>Unique Advantage: Healing</b><br>Furyondy's leader unit, Belvor IV, has the ability to heal allied two-hit units at the beginning of the combat move phase.<br>They must be in the same territory, or an adjoining sea zone in the case of galleys.</body>
Great_KingdomFirstRound=<body><img src="Ivid_V.png"/><h2>Ivid V, the Overking of Aerdy</h2>The Overkings of Aerdy once held sway from Perrenland to the Solnor Ocean, from Ratik to Sunndi.<br>Now, even the North and South Provinces ignore the edicts issuing from Rauxes, and the Holy Censor<br>has practically made the See of Medegia his private kingdom.<br><br>Ivid V, heir to the house of Naelax, ascended to the Malachite throne over the corpses of dozens of siblings<br>and his own father. While not an astute military commander, Ivid's talent for politics and intrigue has only been<br>sharpened by the madness the Malachite Throne imparts to the Overkings, and he does not stint to deal with fiend_lords<br>from the lower planes, much less humanoid mercenaries.<br><br>As his grip on his own nobles tightens, Ivid begins to cast his eyes upon neighboring lands, considering means<br>to bring them to submission and fold them back into the Great Kingdom.<br><br><b>Unique Advantage: Mercenaries</b><br>When successful in recruiting mercenaries, the Great Kingdom receives twice as many units as normal.</body>
NyrondFirstRound=<body><img src="Archbold_III.png"/><h2>King Archbold III of Nyrond</h2>Two-hundred and twenty-eight years ago Nyrond broke free from the Great Kingdom's yoke, and the two have been at war<br>with only brief interludes since.<br><br>The two kingdoms are almost two sides of the same coin, one light and one dark. However, no kingdom is ever truly free<br>from evil, and Archbold III is feeling the weight of years, perhaps made worse by the strife within his own house<br>as his sons bicker over their anticipated inheritance. As the Mad Overking prepares the Great Kingdom for war on a<br>long-unseen scale, Archbold and his Almorian allies can only prepare and pray.<br><br>And then comes the news that the Fists are marching south.<br><br><b>Unique Advantage: Heroes</b><br>Nyrond receives one free hero in the purchase phase of the first turn and can recruit additional heroes at a reduced cost (-5 PUs).<br>Nyrond's leader and hero units can increase the strength of 15 and 8 allied units respectively,<br>rather than the normal 10 and 5.</body>
Scarlet_BrotherhoodFirstRound=<body><img src="The_Father_of_Obedience.png"/><h2>The Father of Obedience</h2>Long isolated and virtually unknown beyond the Okalasna Plateau at the heart of the Tilvanot Peninsula,<br>the Scarlet Brotherhood, or Kingdom of Shar, is a monastic order whose discipline centers on eugenics,<br>espionage, and manipulation on a continental scale. Pulling the strings from deep within the shadows<br>is the mysterious Father of Obedience, who some credit as the mastermind behind many of the events<br>of the Greyhawk Wars, from the abduction of the Prince of Furyondy all the way through to the signing<br>of the Pact of Greyhawk.<br><br>Much of this may be rumor and paranoia, but there is no doubt the Scarlet Brotherhood's ambassadors<br>and assassins have insinuated themselves in the courts of power throughout the Flanaess, and have usurped<br>in spectacular fashion the government of the Sea Princes and several Iron League states.<br><br><b>Unique Advantage: Assassination</b><br>Each turn during the diplomacy phase, the Scarlet Brotherhood can spend PUs in an attempt to assassinate<br>another faction's hero. The hero must be located in a victory city, mercenary, or magic treasure territory,<br>and if multiple heroes are present, one from each faction will die (including allied heroes).<br>Only one successful attempt can be made each turn.</body>
KeolandFirstRound=<body><img src="Skotti.png"/><h2>King Kimbertos Skotti of Keoland</h2>Elected to the Throne of the Lion by the Noble Council of Niole Dra, King Kimbertos Skotti rules the oldest<br>and perhaps most stable of the great nations of the Flanaess. Despite one brief imperialistic period,<br>Keoland enjoys favorable relations with most of its neighbors, including the many elves, dwarves, gnomes,<br>and halflings with which it shares the Sheldomar Valley.<br><br>But the rumor of war and revolution now besets Skotti on all sides. Furyondy pleads for aid in the north,<br>giants raid from the Crystalmists, the Sea Princes are conquered overnight by red-robed assassins, and,<br>most improbably, the Pomarj unites beneath a single banner, bent on revenge.<br><br><b>Unique Advantage: Demi-Humans</b><br>Keoland can recruit halflings, dwarves, and elves at a reduced cost (-1 PU).</body>
KetFirstRound=<body><img src="Beygraf_Zoltan.png"/><h2>Beygraf Zoltan of Ket</h2>Ket, like many crossroads, has spent most of its history passing from the control of one nation to another.<br>Once a province of the Sultanate of Zeif, Ket was overrun by the Brazen Horde two and a half centuries ago.<br>To counter the Horde's aggression, Keoland occupied Ket. But the Ketites fought an insurgency from the hills,<br>fired by the True Faith of Al'Akbar. Eventually successful, Ket at last stood on its own.<br><br>When Iuz came whispering in the ears of the Baklunish nations, he found a willing listener in the Beygraf Zoltan,<br>who thought perhaps now Al'Akbar intended it be Ket that invaded, Ket that conquered, and Ket that ruled.<br>The decision would be where to strike: To humble the haughtiness of Zeif and Ekbir? To seek vengeance on the<br>old foe Keoland? Or, as Iuz suggests, to ride through Bissel and against the soft flank of Furyondy and Veluna?<br><br><b>Unique Advantage: Cavalry</b><br>Ket can recruit cavalry units at a reduced cost (-1 PU).</body>
Iron_LeagueFirstRound=<body><img src="Cobb_Darg.png"/><h2>Cobb Darg of Irongate</h2>In the turmoil of House Naelax's rise to the Great Kingdom's Malachite Throne, several small southern provinces<br>took the opportunity to break away from the empire. Onnwal, Irongate, Idee, Sunndi, and the Lordship of the Isles<br>formed the Iron League, standing together to resist the Overkings they once bowed to.<br><br>As the Iron League ever focuses on the threat of the Great Kingdom, few have questioned the recent ascendancy of<br>red-hooded advisors across the League. After all, they give such excellent, almost prescient, counsel. And why question<br>the source, when the arms and supplies they provide are so desperately needed in the struggle for freedom?<br><br>When the Scarlet Brotherhood finally strikes, only Cobb Darg, Lord Mayor of Irongate, seems to have anticipated<br>the danger. If the League is to survive this knife in the back, it will need all of his ingenuity, and the aid<br>of strong allies.<br><br><b>Unique Advantage: Terrain</b><br>The Iron League's human infantry and cavalry (not including mercenaries) receive terrain bonuses<br>and can blitz in both hills and forests.</body>
PomarjFirstRound=<body><img src="Turrosh_Mak.png"/><h2>The Despot Turrosh Mak</h2>A century ago, elves and dwarves drove the orcs and goblins out of their homes in the Lortmil Mountains.<br>The survivors occupied the Pomarj, enslaving the petty human baronies they found there. But always the memory<br>of the Hateful Wars in which they lost the Lortmils burned in hearts of the humanoids.<br><br>Until now.<br><br>First Turrosh Mak united the Nedla orc tribe with several others. Now, with each conquest, he consolidates<br>his leadership among the humanoids. With promises of revenge and a return to the Lortmils he leads them to invade<br>the Wild Coast and the Principality of Ulek, threatening Celene and even Keoland. With no sign of his momentum slowing,<br>Turrosh Mak may succeed in his goal to establish an "empire where none has stood."<br><br><b>Unique Advantage: Humanoids</b><br>The Pomarj can recruit goblins, hobgoblins, and orcs at a reduced cost (-1 PU).</body>
SuelFirstRound=<body><img src="Ingemar.png"/><h2>King Ingemar Hartensen of the Suel</h2>The Snow Barbarians, or Kingdom of the Schnai, have always bickered with their cousins, the Ice Barbarians (Cruski)<br>and the Frost Barbarians (Fruztii), although their most hated enemies are the Fists to the west and the Great Kingdom<br>to the south, which they raid in their longships annually.<br><br>But when rumors spread that the Five Blades of Corusk have been found, heralding the return of Vatun, the Great<br>God of the North, the Suloise barbarians put aside their feuding. They are even willing to ally with the hated Fists.<br>But then Vatun commands they invade their friends in Ratik and Tenh, and the Suel begin to doubt.<br><br>In truth, it is not Vatun, but Iuz in disguise who urges them to war. If the jarls discover this, will they turn<br>against Iuz for his treachery? Or will they go through with the planned invasion? Or will they simply return<br>to their traditional pattern of raiding the coasts of the Great Kingdom with every year's thaw?<br><br><b>Unique Advantage: Longships</b><br>Suloise ships can carry one additional unit. Suloise conscripts, veterans, champions, and dwarves<br>suffer no penalty when attacking from the sea.</body>


Howl_From_the_North=<body><h2>Howl from the North</h2>By impersonating Vatun, Great God of the North, Iuz attempts to enlist the barbaric Cruski, Schnai,<br>and Fruztii. They are skeptical, but he succeeds in subjugating Sevvord Redbeard, Master of the Hold,<br>and musters the Fists to invade the rich lands to the south.<br><br>Iuz receives 3 PUs every turn it or its allies control 2 out of 4 of:<ul><li>Duchy of Tenh<li>Phostwood<li>Fruztii<li>Krakenheim<ul></body>
Martyrs_of_the_Holy_Shielding=<body><h2>Martyrs of the Holy Shielding</h2>Reluctant to recognize Furyondy's sovereignty, Lord Holmer, Earl of Walworth and Commander<br>of the Knights of the Holy Shielding, ignores King Belvor's warnings that Molag is mustering.<br>Iuz strikes, his humanoid hordes raging like a grass fire across the open fields of the Shield Lands.<br>Lord Holmer's knights fall back to Admundfort, but cannot hold the isle.<br>The Shield Lands have fallen. Furyondy's eastern flank lies exposed.<br><br>Iuz receives 4 PUs every turn it or its allies control Shield Lands and Admundfort.</body>
Wyestil_Shores=<body><h2>Whyestil Shores</h2>Furyondy bolsters its eastern flank, but Iuz pushes through the Vesve Forest, taking Crockport.<br>At the same time, the Horned Society fords the Veng and lays siege to Grabford.<br>Iuz claims the Whyestil's shores, ending Furyondy's dominance over it's "private lake."<br><br>Iuz receives 6 PUs every turn it or its allies control the shores of Whyestil Lake.</body>
Iuz_Exposes_Furyondys_Flank=<body><h2>Iuz Exposes Furyondy's Flank</h2>To claim victory, Iuz must open a new front.<br>He sends emissaries to the Baklunish west; to Zeif, Ekbir, Tusmit, and Ket.<br>If the Archclericy of Veluna is threatened, Furyondy's flank will lie exposed.<br><br>Iuz receives 2 PUs every turn Iuz or its allies control 2 out of 4 of:<ul><li>Lopolla<li>Bramblewood West<li>Mitrick<li>Archclericy of Veluna</ul></body>

Furyondy_Beseiged=<body><h2>Furyondy Beseiged</h2>As the forces of Iuz close in, Furyondy rallies her neighbors and former colonies.<br>Though they have their differences, they all know Furyondy stands as the guardian<br>of civilization against the tide of evil.

Furyondy_Private_Lakes=<body><h2>Private Lakes</h2>Nyr Dyv is vast, and perhaps bottomless. It is a vital crossroads of commerce, for none more so than for Furyondy.<br>Furyondy has also long dominated Lake Whyestil, to the point that it has become a private lake.<br>Or at least it had been during the long imprisonment of the demi-god Iuz.<br><br>Furyondy receives 3 PUs every turn it or its allies control at least 9 territories on the shores of Lake Whyestil and/or Nyr Dyv,<br>AND maintains a naval presence on both lakes.</body>

Great_Kingdom_Wakes=<body><h2>The Great Kingdom Wakes</h2>The Great Kingdom of Aerdy once stretched all the way to Ferrond and the valleys of the Yatils.<br>In recent generations, the diminished empire has struggled merely to maintain control<br>over its North and South Provinces, while the Holy Censor of Medegia openly defies the king.<br>Ivid V must reestablish his supremecy, by blood and terror if need be.<br><br>The Great Kingdom receives 4 PUs every turn it or its allies control 6 out of 9 of:<ul><li>Bone March<li>Eastfair<li>North Province<li>Ahlissa<li>South Province<li>Thelly<li>Pontylver<li>See of Medegia<li>Rel Astra</ul></body>
The_Mad_Overking=<body><h2>The Mad Overking</h2>The Malachite Throne is said to impart the power to speak with, even to summon, fell beings<br>from lower planes. It has also imparted madness to generations of Aerdy kings.<br>Now Ivid V looks south, intent on reclaiming the rebellious states of the Iron League.<br><br>The Great Kingdom receives 3 PUs every turn it or its allies control 3 out of 8 of:<ul><li>Irongate<li>Idee<li>Naerie<li>Pitchfield<li>County of Sunndi<li>Hollow Highlands<li>Rieuwood<li>Glorioles</ul></body>

Sea_Barons=<body><h2>Sea Barons</h2>The overkings of Aerdy have long charged the Sea Barons with protecting the coasts against southern pirates<br>and northern barbarians. If the Sea Barons themselves indulge in occassional privateering, no one complains.<br><br>The Great Kingdom receives 3 PUs every turn it or its allies control Asperdi AND there are no enemey ships in any of:<ul><li>Sea Barons<li>Solnor Ocean<li>Kaport Bay<li>Grendep Bay<li>Spindrift Sound<li>Aerdi Sea</ul></body>

Smashed_Fist=<body><h2>Smashed Fist</h2>Archbold III refuses to abondon his former colonies to their fate.

Nyronds_Eastern_Pact=<body><h2>Nyrond's Eastern Pact</h2>The Great Kingdom's aggression brings Nyrond and the Iron League together.<br>But even before the ink on their alliance can dry, the Scarlet Broterhood's usurpation<br>of Idee complicates the situation.<br><br>Nyrond receives 3 PUs every turn it or its allies control 5 out of 12 of:<ul><li>Onnwal<li>The Headlands<li>Irongate<li>Idee<li>Naerie<li>Pitchfield<li>County of Sunndi<li>Ahlissa<li>Duxchan<li>Sulward City<li>Radigast City<li>County of Urnst</ul></body>

Sea_Princes=<body><h2>Sea Princes</h2>Through subterfuge, bribery, espionage, and assassination the Scarlet Brotherhood reaches its mysterious hand across the Flanaess.<br>But it could not reach far if it lacked the ships to transport its agents to and from the Tilvanot Peninsula.<br><br>The Scarlet Brotherhood receives 4 PUs every turn it or its allies control 2 out of 4 of:<ul><li>Hold of the Sea Princes<li>Fairwind Isle<li>Idee<li>Naerie</ul>AND there are no enemy ships in 13 out of 15 of:<ul><li>Flotsam and Jetsom<li>Jerlea Bay<li>Amedio Bay<li>Sea of Ulek<li>Azure Sea<li>Scant Strait<li>Idee Coast<li>Meno Bay<li>South Olman Isles<li>North Olman Isles<li>Murts Cove<li>Densac Gulf<li>Tilva Strait<li>The Lordship Isles<li>Lordship Isles East</ul></body>
Engaging_Keoland=<body><h2>Engaging Keoland</h2>The Sea Princes laughed at the Scarlet Brotherhood's ultimatum. But once the red-hooded<br>assassins began to strike, they quickly surrendered.

Undermining_the_League=<body><h2>Undermining the League</h2>Following an intricate strategy, the Father of Obedience secretly provides support to the<br>unsuspecting Iron League, helping it withstand the Great Kingdom.

Treaty_of_Niole_Dra=<body><h2>Treaty of Niole Dra</h2>Furyondy labored long to convince Keoland that Iuz was a threat to all.<br>With the signing of the Treaty of Niole Dra, the armies of the south begin to muster.<br>But even before they can make their way through the mountain passes into the north,<br>new threats appear to Keoland's south, west, and east, and King Kimbertos Skotti must<br>decide whether to fight Furyondy's battles or to guard his own frontiers.<br><br>Keoland receives 4 PUs every turn it or its allies control 6 out of 12 of:<ul><li>Hookhill<li>Gran March<li>Celene<li>Duchy of Ulek<li>County of Ulek<li>Jurnre<li>Chendl<li>Verbobonc<li>Dyvers<li>Littleberg<li>Willip<li>Crockport</ul></body>
Against_the_Giants=<body><h2>Against the Giants</h2>From their strongholds in the Crystalmists, giants and ogres surge into the valleys of Geoff and Sterich.<br>King Kimbertos Skotti, his forces diverted to the north, east, and south, has little aid to spare for his former provinces.<br>But he might be able scrape together a rescue, if they will recognize his authority over them once more.<br><br>Keoland receives 2 PUs every turn it or its allies control 5 out of 6 of:<ul><li>Grand Duchy of Geoff<li>Hornwood<li>Sterich<li>Stark Mounds<li>Flen<li>Oyt Wood</ul></body>

Ket_Consolidates=<body><h2>Ket Consolidates</h2>Among the remnants of the ancient Baklunish empire, Ket has long been an afterthought,<br>a highway through which trade and maurading armies have passed. Greater, more civilized states<br>like the Sultanate of Zeif and the Caliphate of Ekbir have looked down on Ket, and even<br>the infidels of the east scorn the Ketites.

CairnUngovernable=<body><h2>The Cairn Hills are ungovernable!</h2>The Cairn Hills are aptly named, riddled with ancient burial sites, some of which may still hold treasure.<br>But no matter how many troops you pour into it, the region resists conquest. You cannot raise armies there,<br>and at the start of every turn in which you occupy the territory, more locals rise in rebellion.<br>You will either have to withdraw to an allied territory, or fight them again.<br>Is the chance at treasure really worth it?</body>
VastUngovernable=<body><h2>The Vast Swamp is ungovernable!</h2>The Tilvanot Peninsula may as well be an island. No matter how many troops you pour into it,<br>the Vast Swamp remains a trackless wilderness, crawling with bullywugs and worse.

You will either have to withdraw to an allied territory, or fight again.<br>Is the chance at rumored treasure really worth it?</body>
ColdUngovernable=<body><h2>The Temple of the Frog is ungovernable!</h2>No matter how many troops you pour into them, the Cold Marshes remain a bleak, icy wilderness, filled with danger.<br>You cannot raise armies there, and at the start of every turn in which you occupy the territory, more monsters<br>rise in rebellion. You will either have to withdraw to an allied territory, or fight again.<br>Is the chance at treasure really worth it?</body>
ValleyUngovernable=<body><h2>The Valley of the Mage is ungovernable!</h2>No matter how many troops you pour into it, the seemingly idyllic Valley of the Mage is essentially a trap.<br>"The Black One," Jaran Krimeah, the exiled former Archmage of the Great Kingdom, left behind numberless<br>magical wards and charmed monsters to protect his accumulated treasures. The local populace of the hidden valley<br>also remains loyal to him.<br><br>You cannot raise armies there, and at the start of every turn you occupy the valley, more foes rise against you.<br>You will either have to withdraw to an allied territory, or fight again.<br>Is the chance at treasure worth it?</body>

LoReltarmaUngovernable=<body><h2>Lo Reltarma is ungovernable!</h2>The Spindrift Isles are too remote to effectively control.

TelaneteculiUngovernable=<body><h2>Telaneteculi is ungovernable!</h2>The largely unexplored Amedio Jungle extends for hundreds of leagues.

You must either withdraw to an allied territory, or fight again.</body>
RakersUngovernable=<body><h2>The Forsaken Mount is ungovernable!</h2>The humanoids that now roam the Bone March originally descended from the sharp peaks of the Rakers.<br>There are still orcs in the Forsaken Mount, and some seem guided by a greater intelligence,<br>one that is searching for something.
